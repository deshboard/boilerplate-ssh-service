# Setup

This page explains the steps to setup the project stack for local usage.

Do not mix it up with the page with the same name under [development/](development/):
this guide explains how to setup the project for *running it* locally,
not how to *develop* it.

Note that these instructions may not apply to a production environment.


## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
